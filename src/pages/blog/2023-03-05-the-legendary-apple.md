## ﻿**PROLOGUE**

  "﻿I don't get this type of farming!" cried Tim. "﻿Look, the steps are easy. First, plant the seeds. Then, give the seeds average water & sunlight and wait until they grow. Soon, you will have an apple tree as tall as you!" said Michael. "﻿Do we do the same for the magical apples?" asked Tim. "﻿No, we simply use our powers to plant them." replied Michael.

  "﻿Then why don't we use our powers to plant normal apples?"

  "﻿People on Earth are getting suspicious that our apples aren't organic."

  "﻿Why should they care?"

  "﻿I don't know, maybe they want to...stay healthy?"

  "﻿But shouldn't they-

  "Just...stop asking questions. You were annoying enough before." interrupted Michael. Michael always hated when he had to tutor his little brother, Tim. Tim would always anger Michael in a way, but today, Tim didn't bother Michael much. Suddenly, the boys' father came into the room. Michael's heart leaped with hope. Maybe if his dad gave him an exciting job, today would be a great day for Michael. He didn't have any issues with Tim yet, and a fun job would be terrific! "Alright. Michael, you can head on over to the Fruit Sorting Chamber and sort the apples. Tim, clean the chicken coop." said Michael's dad. <I>Of course, my dreams don't come true. </I> Michael thought. 

  The Fruit Sorting Chamber was probably one of the most boring workplaces on Schtah. Schtah is one of the places that delivers fruit and vegetables, so kind of like a farm heaven, if it's a thing. As Michael walked into the 'Apple Sorting' section, it looked boring as usual. It had one conveyor belt, and a square pipe extending from the ceiling, with its opening facing towards the beginning of the conveyor belt. This chute would drop crates, and these crates would have either a sparkling apple print on the front, or a normal apple print, depending on what the crate contains. The person's job was to load the crates onto separate conveyor belts, one conveyor belt for the sparkling apples, and one conveyor belt for the normal apples. The sparkling apples were made for the workers to eat, and the organic ones were for Earthlings. It was crucial that a magical apple wouldn't get onto Earth, because no one knew what could happen.
